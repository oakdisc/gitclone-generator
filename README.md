# Git Clone Generator

Welcome to the **Git Clone Generator**! This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and [`Material UI`](https://github.com/mui/material-ui). This powerful tool allows developers to generate personalized git clone and git config commands while remembering user-specific information such as ID, username, email, and preferred clone method, including SSH profile names.

## Project Description

The Git Clone Generator is designed to streamline the process of cloning multiple repositories. It not only simplifies the setup process by generating tailored git clone and git config commands but also remembers user preferences for a more personalized experience. Whether you're working on personal projects, contributing to open-source, or managing team collaborations, this tool saves time and reduces the hassle of manual setup.

## Features

- **Personalized Commands**: Generate git clone and git config commands based on user preferences, including SSH profile names.
- **User Information Storage**: Remembers user details such as ID, username, email, and preferred clone method for future use.
- **Organized Setup**: Keep your development environment tidy by organizing cloned repositories into designated folders.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive UI that guides you through the cloning process with ease.
